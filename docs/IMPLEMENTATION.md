# Implementation ledger: M1 and M2

This file records current contracts and execution evidence as gates are built.
DESIGN.md describes the broader target architecture. No entry below implies
userspace isolation, SMP safety, driver containment or production readiness.

## M1a: exception entry

The IDT has 256 ring-0 interrupt gates. Assembly normalizes CPU error-code and
non-error-code exceptions, saves all 15 ordinary registers, clears direction,
aligns the C call stack and invokes a bounded fatal handler. `je_trap_frame`
has compile-time size/offset assertions. In 64-bit mode the CPU frame includes
SS:RSP even at CPL0. Return infrastructure uses IRETQ, with no user transitions,
SIMD state, GS switching or speculative execution mitigation claims yet.

A new GDT retains the existing kernel selectors and adds an available 64-bit TSS.
TSS IST1 is a separate 16 KiB double-fault stack; IST2 is a separate NMI stack.
Each has a reserved leading guard page to unmap during M1b. No IRQ is enabled in
M1a. Exceptions print vector/error/RIP and CR2 for page faults, then halt. Recursive
panic attempts halt directly. These development addresses are local serial data;
there is no remote collection. Production diagnostics/redaction remains future.

Fault modes 1/2/3 inject UD2, an invalid data selector, and a page fault with an
absent page-fault gate respectively. The last case exercises an actual CPU double
fault and the TSS emergency path; a software `int $8` would not produce the same
error-code frame. Fault builds live in `build/<mode>/`; normal build is `build/0/`.
The emulator harness requires exact expected vector/error and terminal markers;
QEMU exit or elapsed time without evidence is failure.

## Verification history

M1a: GCC/ELF checks, hosted core tests, QEMU normal boot and modes 1, 2, 3
passed before proceeding to M1b. Mode 2 uses GDT selector 0x28, just beyond the
installed table limit, to deterministically exercise #GP with error code 0x28. Consult HANDOFF.md for final observed
results after the complete phase sequence.

## M1b: boot data and protected mappings

A portable Multiboot2 parser copies bounded memory-map records and reservation
intervals. It rejects undersized/truncated tags, bad alignment/strides, unsupported
map versions, wrapping physical ranges, ambiguous overlapping maps, malformed
module bounds/strings, missing/duplicate maps and absent terminal tags. Unknown
memory types are never allocatable. Fixed-capacity overflow returns a failure;
output remains invalid. The image must be ordinary RAM. Low 1 MiB, the complete
image (including BSS page tables/stacks), boot block and modules stay reserved.
The parser retains no loader pointers. The architecture validates the loader
address against the bootstrap map before reading; it cannot prove faulty firmware
has provided physically backed memory merely from the mapping. A bad access is a
fatal diagnosed exception, not recoverable firmware parsing.

Fresh 4 KiB supervisor page tables identity-map complete type-1 RAM pages from
1 MiB up to a deliberate 1 GiB implementation limit. Holes and reserved firmware
ranges remain unmapped. Kernel text is read-only/executable, rodata read-only,
and writable RAM non-executable when NX exists. CR0.WP enforces supervisor writes;
EFER.NXE is enabled before installing NX entries. There are no writable aliases
for code. The bootstrap, double-fault and NMI stacks have unmapped leading guards.
On NX-absent CPUs the same read-only/guard checks apply, but data non-execution is
explicitly unavailable. This is an early identity-mapped kernel, not KASLR or a
user/kernel split. Page-table metadata itself remains writable by trusted kernel
code; no privileged module isolation is claimed.

Validation: 20,000 deterministic parser mutations plus explicit truncation,
overflow, overlap, module and reservation cases pass ASan/UBSan. Local leak
checking is disabled (`ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0`) because the execution sandbox
cannot inspect process threads; address and undefined-behavior checks stay active.
CI keeps default leak checking. CPU fault tests observe code-write #PF (error 3),
guard read #PF (0), data execute #PF (17), and a real stack exhaustion double fault
using the emergency IST. NX-absent normal boot also passes.
