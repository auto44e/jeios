# Coding-agent starting guide

Owner-approved [two-phase native shell and selectable shell roadmap](SHELLS.md): recovery + original JeiOS sh, included native Bash/Zsh, and bring-your-own shell. PowerShell deferred. Planned, not runtime support.

## Current ecosystem status — observed 2026-11-01T21:30:30-05:00

Core main `0f702036c52d40d03bb4c8919d0dcae53ba9f2b1`: AMD64 M3 and scoped M4 complete; PR #70
merged. ARM64 MP1 complete (#52); MP2 then MP3 remain. Main CI passed:
https://github.com/auto44e/jeios/actions/runs/41376309893 . M4 qualifies bounded
supervisor/broker/COM2 UART scenarios, not arbitrary hardware, DMA or a release.
Mobile main `f1d9b0d87746e9dc353a2f48e7b9d27e7fe86d07` has passing planning CI:
https://github.com/auto44e/jeios-mobile/actions/runs/39243515951 . Its core pin
remains older M1/M2; upstream progress does not qualify that integration.
No open PRs were observed before this refresh. M4 #53 is now closed as completed;
MP2 (mobile #2) is next execution work; M5a #54 remains planned.

Shell roadmap: SH1 recovery #71, SH2 original native sh #72, included native
Bash/Zsh and custom-shell registration #73; mobile parity #12. PowerShell deferred.
All shell implementation remains planned. Storage, networking, desktop, POSIX
completion, LDAP, encryption, fleet/ISO 27001 features, RISC-V, accelerators and
Android execution remain later gates. Standards adoption is not certification.
This current status supersedes older next-task/status wording below; timestamped
records remain evidence at their original revisions, not new test runs.


Standards adopted as design requirements (2026-10-26): [standards and evidence](STANDARDS.md)
and [organizational ISO 27001 support features](ORG_SECURITY.md). Implementation
and formal qualification remain gated; these documents add no runtime behavior.

Ecosystem scope: [CPU, GPU, APU and NPU architecture support](ARCHITECTURE_SUPPORT.md)
across kernel, drivers, runtimes, SDK, applications and product profiles. Planning
scaffolds do not establish runtime or hardware qualification.

RISC-V: [RV64 scaffold and gated port plan](RISCV.md) added 2026-10-24.
Planning only; no RISC-V execution or hardware support claimed. Existing core
and ARM64 implementation priorities remain unchanged.

Updated 2026-10-19. Read this with ../AGENTS.md, HANDOFF.md and IMPLEMENTATION.md.
Owner requested a sustained coding-agent handoff. This guide records requirements
and continuation order; it does not claim later milestones are implemented.

Current status and timestamped history: [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md). Ecosystem-wide
[zero trust](ZERO_TRUST.md) is an owner requirement; enforcement remains planned.

## Product philosophy across every subsystem

Owner clarification 2026-10-14: seamless everyday defaults plus granular,
customizable power-user/developer/organization control govern the whole OS and
ecosystem. Read the overall product vision near the start of DESIGN.md.
Security profiles are one application; apply the same progressive disclosure,
per-area customization, automation, coherent cross-device behavior and honest
recovery principles to all subsystem work. These are requirements, not implemented
features. Keep interface complexity separate from actual authority and capability.

## Establish the correct baseline

Inspected `main` at `11a02adf744874328371b7f9f3bc801623995980`. M1/M2 and M3a/b/c are merged;
issues #2–#8 are closed. AMD64 qualifies experimental single-CPU userspace,
typed handles, capability IPC and a two-process bootstrap fixture. ARM64 MP0 is
accepted; MP1 entry/console/vectors are implemented with local QEMU evidence.
DTB parsing remains. See M3A_RETRO.md, M3C_RETRO.md and HANDOFF.md for scope.

Not implemented: general service supervisor, SMP, filesystem, networking,
desktop/media runtime, login/sync/encryption or Android runtime. M3's bounded
fixture is not a general init or hardened sandbox. Start from updated main and
check concurrent work/CI before edits.

## Work sequence and project-ready tasks

Follow [NEXT_PHASE.md](NEXT_PHASE.md): core #52 finishes MP1 and remote ARM boot
CI; #53 defines and implements M4 service/device lifecycle; #54 follows relevant
M4 gates with read-only initfs, service loading and a diagnostic console.
Mobile #2 tracks MP2/MP3 parity. Existing #13–#16 and #18/#19 remain open.
No assignee or calendar deadline is implied. The board is
https://github.com/users/auto44e/projects/1/views/1 .

M3A.md is the historical proposal; accepted ADRs 0007–0009 and the implementation
ledger govern actual contracts. Preserve owner gates for frozen/tested paths.

## Owner requirements and authoritative design locations

| Requirement | Source and placement | Implementation boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fresh C11 core, modular services, Unix interoperability/NT-style object model | [DESIGN](DESIGN.md), ADR 0001/0002 | No foreign kernel-source fusion; ring 0 is trusted |

| Smart CPU→GPU/NPU offloading, configurable APIs, conservative defaults | [ACCELERATORS](ACCELERATORS.md) | Eligible backend implementations, resource/latency/power budgets, precision and CPU fallback |
| Built-in FFmpeg, HandBrake and Blackmagic RAW support | [ACCELERATORS](ACCELERATORS.md), M5–M8 | Userspace integration; separate upstream licenses and native SDK feasibility |
| Apache-2.0 selected for original project code | [LICENSE](../LICENSE), [ADR 0005](adr/0005-licensing.md) | Implemented licensing; third-party provenance/terms still reviewed |
| Old AMD64 compatibility, AArch64/mobile/IoT and coherent customizable desktop | [HARDWARE](HARDWARE.md), [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md), [DESIGN](DESIGN.md) | Qualified profiles and dependency gates; no shortcut past isolation |

## Sustained implementation discipline

Work one bounded gate at a time; continue routine implementation and fixes without
reasking already decided owner preferences. Keep small reviewable commits. Record
new architectural decisions and rationale in ADRs. Ask only when a material owner
decision or access limitation genuinely blocks useful work. Do not silently relax
security, replace standards-first goals with mandatory vendor dependencies, or
claim a later gate because its design document exists.

Before each change, inspect current code, open issues/PRs and tests to avoid
redoing work or overwriting another agent. Prioritize executable user-page aliases,
unsaved architectural state, safe TSS/CR3 switching, exact copy fixups, lifetime
and reclamation. A security invariant that cannot be upheld blocks the feature;
record the failure and next bounded fix rather than forging a passing gate.

At each checkpoint update HANDOFF, IMPLEMENTATION and ROADMAP in the same change:
implemented/tested/planned/blocked, exact commit and commands, observed results,
changed contracts, known failures and next task. Update related security/hardware
claims and issue state only to match evidence. Keep local and remote CI distinct.
Run `make check`; in this managed environment use
`ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0 make check` only if LeakSanitizer cannot inspect tasks,
and disclose that limitation. Boot changes require `make smoke integration` with
new meaningful QEMU tests, exact expected results and a live survivor for fault
containment. Run `git diff --check` and validate documentation links.

Before ending a work session leave reproducible build/run instructions, current
branch/commit, a clean committed checkpoint where possible, remaining test failures,
resource/accounting invariants and next step. Do not merge/release, assign reviewers,
change credentials, contact vendors or import restricted source without applicable
authorization. The owner asked to approve PR #1; that is not an instruction to
invent an independent reviewer or silently bypass self-review restrictions.

## Historical requirement additions

The dated records below preserve earlier priorities and status wording. Current
status and task ordering above and in NEXT_PHASE.md supersede that wording; the
owner requirements remain active.

## Cryptographic relock requirement — 2026-10-14

ENCRYPTION.md now requires a configurable ordinary-lock path to withdraw protected
user-domain keys and plaintext access without a power cycle. Include process/cache/
DMA cleanup, credential-gated reopening, background exceptions and truthful failure
status. Screen lock alone is insufficient; reboot equivalence is not assumed.
Key-domain and lifecycle design precede storage/identity format freeze; runtime
qualification remains a later gate. No implementation was added.

## Protected system and version management — owner decision 2026-10-14

STORAGE.md records seamless protected/versioned system deployments by default,
full owner customization including an immutability off switch, and independent
intuitive OS/built-in-app update/rollback in both protected and mutable modes.
Native apps must participate through lifecycle and schema compatibility contracts.
Write protection, deployment history, trust policy and data encryption are distinct.
Mutable-mode direct edits require explicit conflict/checkpoint handling; rollback
must not silently revert user documents or bypass data/anti-rollback constraints.
Accepted direction, not implemented behavior; M3a remains next.

## Multiple default filesystems — owner decision 2026-10-14

STORAGE.md now records Btrfs, OpenZFS and a mobile backend as first-class long-term
default choices selected by qualified device profiles. F2FS is the proposed mobile
candidate. Owners can select a conforming custom backend, including as system
default with additional boot/recovery qualification, or use a visibly experimental
profile. Native APIs keep workflows coherent without claiming identical features.
ext4 stays the initial bring-up target. No automatic reformat/conversion or new
implementation is implied. M3a remains next.

## F2FS approval and agent tasks — 2026-10-14T20:43:47-04:00

Owner approved F2FS as the provisional mobile default, subject to actual JeiOS
qualification. This supersedes earlier candidate-only wording; device support,
feature flags and production readiness are not implied. Btrfs/OpenZFS remain
long-term default targets; ext4 remains the initial core bring-up backend.

Ready-to-start bounded work:
- [Core #13](https://github.com/auto44e/jeios/issues/13): backend contract ADR,
  hosted fake-block-device and conformance harness.
- [Core #14](https://github.com/auto44e/jeios/issues/14): F2FS format/provenance
  review and bounded read-only hosted metadata probe with negative tests.
- [Mobile #7](https://github.com/auto44e/jeios-mobile/issues/7): mobile F2FS
  workload/qualification profile and shared-backend integration plan.

These issues are open/unassigned at creation; no coding agent has been launched
by creating them and project-board membership has not been verified. Hosted
prototypes can proceed independently while runtime integration waits for M3/M4/M5
and relevant mobile execution/driver gates. No writes to real user media.
M3a remains the next core kernel gate; MP0 remains the mobile architecture gate.

## Core standards workstreams — 2026-10-16

Read [STANDARDS.md](STANDARDS.md). POSIX.1-2024 and built-in LDAPv3 are accepted
core commitments; staged runtime implementation remains blocked on native gates.
[POSIX #15](https://github.com/auto44e/jeios/issues/15) defines the profile and
conformance roadmap; [LDAP #16](https://github.com/auto44e/jeios/issues/16) defines
the isolated provider and identity-broker contract. Begin bounded design work
without displacing M3a. Mobile parity reuses these contracts and implementations.
Historical wording that treats generic LDAP as only a candidate is superseded.

## Curl-inspired CI direction — 2026-10-16

[CI_STRATEGY.md](CI_STRATEGY.md) records the owner's short/long-term testing goal:
portable regressions, compiler diversity, sanitizers/static analysis, replayable
failure injection and fuzzing, supplemented by native kernel execution and storage
crash-recovery qualification. [Core #18](https://github.com/auto44e/jeios/issues/18)
is the first bounded CI implementation task. Existing gates remain mandatory;
M3a and mobile MP0 remain next. This update adds planning only, not workflow jobs.

## Ecosystem assurance direction — 2026-10-16

[CODING_STANDARD.md](CODING_STANDARD.md) defines NASA/JPL-inspired risk profiles
and ten project rules. Core #19 tracks baseline audit and enforcement, alongside
CI #18. Apply across core, services, apps, tooling and mobile; no compliance audit
or new CI checks are claimed. M3a remains next.
